Title: Use the HYSPLIT model from inside R
Description: Use the HYSPLIT model from inside R. Access data, set up trajectory
    and dispersion models, execute the model runs, and obtain on-disk and
    in-memory model results. WARNING: THIS IS A MODIFIED VERSION OF THE ORIGINAL SPLITR PACKAGE (modified by Alkuin Koenig)
    Comment Alkuin Koenig: <<I Changed several functions slightly to be more generous in the selection of needed meteorological files.
    This is to fix some bugs that I encountered concerning meteo files in gap years (eg. 29.02.2012), as well as a bug
    that I encountered when trying to compute back trajectories with starting hours of 22:00 or 23:00, when the day corresponds to the last day
    of the meterological file. The functions that were changed are: get_monthly_filenames and get_daily_filenames in utils.R, as well as get_met_gdas1.R.
    \
    UPDATE: AMK 2023/10/13 . I also had to update the trajectory_read function, to make it compatible with latest HYSPLIT releases.
